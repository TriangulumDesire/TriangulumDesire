### Matthew Schäfer.

* I'm a developer from Australia who loves making 2D games 🎮, game engines 🕹️, and programming languages 🖥️.
* My favourite languages include `C++`, `Rust`, `C#`, and 'OCaml' (but all languages are awesome in their own ways).
* Outside of programming I enjoy cricket 🏏, cycling 🚲, and running 🏃.
* Pronouns: He (subjective), him (objective), his (genitive/possessive), his (possessive determiner), himself (reflexive).
